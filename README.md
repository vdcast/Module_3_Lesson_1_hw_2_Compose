**Lesson's topic:**

Database.

**Task:**

Create a database of your pets. The pet has: type, name, height, weight. The name is unique.
You can add and remove animals. As such, there is no viewing of animals, but there is a search. There is a search by name (exact identifier) and search by type (a list of found animals is displayed).

**Result: Screen recoding** (please, note that it was converted to GIF, so it's not smooth as it was):
